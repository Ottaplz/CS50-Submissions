Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: I thought there would be more processing time between the first 10, 100 and 1000 simulations but it was almost negligible overall. 1000 simulations also gave a very competitive output compared to the higher totals also.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: I would say 10000 simulations gives a very consistent output of chance to win within a reasonable amount of computing time compared to larger simulations.
