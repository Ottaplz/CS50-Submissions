If I had to characterize the audio aura of this listener, I would classify it as "Blue". Their music taste seems to vary greatly between high tempo/danceability songs and low tempo/danceability songs.
This may not be indicative of their true aura because there are so many more factors that go into music than just "danceability", "energy" and "valence". I think tempo and speechiness could also play a role in determining someones music aura. Also not just calculating the averages of values, if the user has very varied tastes than a mean calculation of songs generic values could greatlky skew their true taste.
